Into the Thick of It
====================

## Description

This is [my entry](http://ludumdare.com/compo/minild-68/?action=preview&uid=85426) for [Mini Ludum Dare 68](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/06/13/minild-68-announcement/) (Theme: Childhood memories).

In my childhood one of my greatest influences was without a doubt the legendary video game Secret of Mana.

As a tribute I created a small endless hack&slash with my own clone of the famous Rabite enemy. How many can you kill before they kill you?

I hope you enjoy this small game!
